# Code Sample NWEA

Copyright (c) 2016 Lisa Gray

This application was made to play the card game war.

It is unfinished compared to my original vision, ran out of time due to previous commitments.

Future tasks:
  -break up Game component into multiple components (Player, Field)
  -use spritesheet and canvas to render a deck/hand and each card
  -rather than automatically playing the game, have a play turn button and animate card flips
  -extract out game class to handle all the game logic and add testing
  -create components and use canvas to draw and update field
